## Guidelines

Identify the most important actions

If everything looks important, then nothing is important - Patric Lencioni

Users need to be certain of what action to take next. You need to know which actions are the most important within a given section of the user flow.

Once you’ve identified which actions are the most important at the moment, you can indicate importance through size, type, and variation.

> Yay:  
> The secondary small button is great for actions in cards as it stands out from the interface but doesn’t take so much attention.

> Please note:  
> If you have a repeated view, use the secondary button for the main action. Primary buttons would offer too many choices to select from.

### Buttons with icons

Buttons with icons are great when you need to draw more attention to the action. Icons add additional context and makes the buttons more easy to scan.

But it’s essential to not overuse these buttons. If everything is grabbing attention, things usually get messy.
